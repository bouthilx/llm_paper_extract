    "description": "This paper introduces Geom3D, a unified benchmarking platform for symmetry-informed geometric representation models used in modeling molecules, proteins, and crystalline materials. Geom3D benchmarks 16 geometric models and 14 geometric pretraining methods over 46 datasets across various scientific domains. The main contribution is providing a unified, symmetry-informed geometric representation and extensive evaluation of various models and datasets.",

      "quote": "Nevertheless, pursuing geometric learning research is still challenging due to its evolving nature and the knowledge gap between science (e.g., physics) and machine learning communities. These factors contribute to a substantial barrier for machine learning researchers to investigate scientific problems and hinder efforts to reproduce results consistently. To overcome this, we introduce Geom3D, a benchmarking of the geometric representation with four advantages, as follows."
