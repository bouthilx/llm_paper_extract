    "description": "The paper presents a novel algorithm called Implicit Diffusion to optimize distributions defined implicitly by parameterized stochastic diffusions. The proposed method performs optimization and sampling jointly, inspired by bilevel optimization and automatic implicit differentiation. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in real-world settings.",
