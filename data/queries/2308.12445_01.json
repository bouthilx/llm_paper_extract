    "description": "The paper proposes Dr. DRL, a self-healing approach for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems that integrates intentional forgetting within continual learning to improve adaptability and healing efficiency against environmental drifts. The approach is evaluated using several DRL algorithms on various Gym environments and demonstrates enhanced adaptability, reduced healing time, and improved performance in comparison to vanilla continual learning.",
