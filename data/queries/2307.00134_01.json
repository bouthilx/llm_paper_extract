    "description": "This paper explores the generalization properties and limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning identity effects, which is determining if an object comprises two identical components. It presents a theoretical analysis backed by numerical experiments to show that GNNs struggle with this task when using orthogonal encodings but can successfully classify symmetric dicyclic graphs.",

Our contributions are the following: (i) extending the analysis of [44], GNNs are shown to be incapable of learning identity effects via SGD training under sufficient conditions determined by the existence of a suitable transformation ùúè of the input space (Theorem 3.1); an application to the problem of classifying identical two-letter words is provided by Theorem 3.3 and supported by numerical experiments in ¬ß4.2;"
