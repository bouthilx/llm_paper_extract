    "description": "This paper introduces an algorithm named Implicit Diffusion for optimizing distributions defined implicitly by parameterized stochastic diffusions. It integrates optimization and sampling processes in a single loop, inspired by bilevel optimization, aiming to optimize over the space of probability distributions. Theoretical guarantees and empirical results are provided.",
