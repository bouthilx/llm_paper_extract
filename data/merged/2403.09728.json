It provides formal proofs for the ability of transformers to compactly simulate these automata and offers empirical evidence through synthetic experiments.",

    "quote": "In this work, we show that transformers can simulate weighted finite automata (WFAs), a class of models which subsumes DFAs, as well as weighted tree automata (WTA), a generalization of weighted automata to tree structured inputs. We prove these claims formally and provide upper bounds on the sizes of the transformer models needed as a function of the number of states the target automata."
